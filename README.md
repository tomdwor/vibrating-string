# Vibrating string equation

It's a simulation of a vibrating string (without damping).
It uses a numerical solution of the vibrating string differential equation.

## Commands

```
$ npm install                               # install modules
$ npx webpack serve --mode=development      # run the webpack dev-server
$ npx webpack                               # or `npx webpack build` - build distribution
```
